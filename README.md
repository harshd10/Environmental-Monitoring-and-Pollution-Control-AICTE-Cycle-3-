🌍 Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control – AICTE Internship Project. This repository contains the first phase of my internship project, focused on environmental monitoring and pollution control. The goal is to build a web-based system that processes real-world data to visualize pollution levels, detect anomalies, and support smarter decision-making for sustainability and safety. 📌 Project Overview This phase involves:

- Sourcing a relevant dataset from Kaggle
- Cleaning and transforming the data
